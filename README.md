# Notes - LP3

## Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)

### Generating Fibonacci numbers

- Both, iterative and recursive approaches are linear time w.r.t. to the input $T(n) \in \mathcal{O}(n)$
- Recursive approach takes more stack-space (proportional to `n`)


### Huffmann Encoding

- Optimal prefix-codes used in loss-less data compression
- Codes are variable-length, where the length of each code is inversely proportional to the frequency of the corresponding symbol
